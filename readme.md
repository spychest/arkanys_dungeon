# Arkany's Dungeon

## Introduction

This project is just for fun and inspired by Ogame. It will not be for a commercial use, it's really just for fun. The goal of this application is to increase my knoledge in javascript and to be focused on something. The final application must be an Ogame like game but in the universe of D&D.
