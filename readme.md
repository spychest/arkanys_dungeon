# Arkany's Dungeon

## Introduction

This project is just for fun and inspired by Ogame. It will not be for a commercial use, it's really just for fun. The goal of this application is to increase my knoledge in javascript and to be focused on something. The final application must be an Ogame like game but in the universe of D&D.

## Resources

The game will work with four main resources:

- Gold
- Wood
- Stone
- Magic energy

## Buildings

To get an easy view of the different building, I grouped them by usage (production, storage, military, etc.)
